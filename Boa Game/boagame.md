# Boa Game

Boa Game is a classic snake game implementation using HTML canvas and JavaScript. Guide the boa, control its movement, and help it grow. Customize the snake's appearance, challenge yourself with power-ups and a new mouse element, and strive to achieve the highest score.

## Instructions

1. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the boa.
2. The objective of the game is to eat the apples to grow your boa and earn points.
3. **Warning:** After the mouse power-up effect wears off, make sure to eat an apple to return to normal speed. If the snake is caught outside of the game board or eats itself when the mouse effect disappears, it's game over.
4. Avoid colliding with the walls or the boa itself, as it will result in a game over.
5. Power-up feature: When you reach 10 points, a power-up activates, either slowing down or speeding up the player. Power-up apples are worth 10 points, and the randomly generated mouse is worth 20 points.
   - **Speed Power-up:** Snake speeds up for a limited time.
   - **Slowdown Power-up:** Snake slows down for a limited time.
6. Try to achieve the highest score possible, utilizing power-ups, and beat your previous high score.
