## Technologies/Languages Used

The Polaroid camera is created using the following technologies and languages:

- **HTML:** Hypertext Markup Language is used to structure the web page and define its elements, including buttons and div containers.

- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets are used to style and design the camera elements. It defines colors, shapes, animations, and positioning.

- **JavaScript:** JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the camera. It handles button clicks, triggers animations, and plays the sound effect.

- **Audio:** An audio file (alien.mp3) is included and played using JavaScript to provide a sound effect when the button is clicked.

The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript brings the Polaroid camera to life, creating a visually appealing and interactive web element.
