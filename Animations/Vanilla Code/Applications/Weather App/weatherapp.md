### Weather App

## Overview

- The Weather App is a web-based application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specific city. It provides information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, sunrise, sunset, cloudiness, visibility, and temperature units (Celsius or Fahrenheit). The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data for the entered city.

## Features

- City Input: Users can enter the name of the city for which they want to retrieve weather information.

- Search Button: Clicking the "Search" button initiates the weather data retrieval process.

- Temperature Units: Users can choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit as their preferred temperature units.

- Display Weather Information: Once the user searches for a city, the app displays detailed weather information, including temperature, description, humidity, wind speed, pressure, sunrise and sunset times, cloudiness, visibility, and minimum and maximum temperatures.

- Error Handling: The app provides error messages for scenarios such as entering an invalid city name or encountering API request errors.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: The app's structure is built using HTML to create the user interface and elements.

- CSS: CSS styles are applied to enhance the visual appearance of the app, including fonts, colors, and layout.

- JavaScript: JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the app, handle user input, fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API, and update the DOM with weather information.

- OpenWeatherMap API: The app relies on the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for the specified city.
