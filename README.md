Updates to files 9/8/2023. Updated Physics Animation and water 4-7 with the colors from my colorsplosion game and added more bright colors so the scenes should be even more vibrant in the animations. 

5 html5 browser games and 12 Animations. 1 3D animated game. Using as little assets and libraries as possible to create these. Upgrading my animations and game development from 2000-2010. Next I am working on Unreal Game Engine and Blender to advance my game development and animations.

Used throughout these projects are the following. Three.JS, Cannon.JS, JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, Webgl, Canvas, JavaScript,
Creative Concept Design, Game Development, Game Design. Very few images or sounds were imported but if they were they were credited in the readme's. Not every project took everything listed above.

Animations if interactive which most are use mouse and arrow keys for interaction and movements. If anything is broken or needs attention let me know for the games or animations. 

NOTE ABOUT THESE GAMES AND ANIMATIONS BELOW:

In July 2023, I resumed my creative journey in game and animation development after a hiatus since 2010. Returning to the familiar tools of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML5 felt great. I took it upon myself to use very few external resources for these projects I had in mind to add to my portfolio just like I had in my youth. I wanted to limit what I could use and see what I could create. The browser games I made were versions I had created growing up...along with some new ones.

These animations tested the boundaries and limits of what I was using by integrating WebGL, Three.js, and Cannon.js for complex tasks. 98% of these projects were crafted exclusively through code.

The primary objective of this endeavor was to emphasize that immersive animations and engaging games just like when I was growing up can be brought to life solely through code. Plus I love a good challenge. To further expand my skills, I learned Cannon.js, Three.js, WebGL, and Canvas during this process.
