I figured those out last night. I present the final game in the project.

### Updates to files 9/10/2023. Added in to Animations vanilla code a audio animation player that takes any mp3 and converts the sound, music and voice to realistic synth waves each in a retro design. Working on a bigger project but threw this together in 30 minutes and it soothes me. Might do the same for someone else.

### Updates to files 9/9/2023. Added in MineSweep game to the games folder along with the markdown and mp3. I had finished this game but never figured out the flagging until last night, so I decided to upload it as the final game for this project. I am still trying to fix the animated maze game red wall issue so it transfers the player to the next level it is the only project not fully working yet. For Creep Annihilator I added in the option to refresh the page to choose between the stone and grass backgrounds without the needing of changing the code. Enjoy!

### Updates to files 9/8/2023. Updated Physics Animation, Colorsplosion game and water animations 4-7 with the colors from my colorsplosion game (Added a lot more vibrant colors to Colorsplosion bricks and particles also).

## 9 html5 browser games and 14 Animations. 1 3D animated game. 10 applications. Using as little assets and libraries as possible to create these. Timeframe ranging from July 1st -September 18th of 2023. Upgrading my animations and game development from 2000-2010 to current time. Last time I did any of this was back in 2010. Next I am working on Unreal Game Engine and Blender to advance my game development and animations.

* Used throughout these projects are the following. Three.JS, Cannon.JS, JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, Webgl, Canvas, JavaScript,
Creative Concept Design, Game Development, Game Design. Very few images or sounds were imported but if they were they were credited in the readme's. Not every project took everything listed above.

* Animations if interactive which most are use mouse and arrow keys for interaction and movements. If anything is broken or needs attention let me know for the games or animations. 

## NOTE ABOUT THESE GAMES AND ANIMATIONS BELOW:

* In August 2023, I resumed my creative journey in game and animation development after a hiatus since 2010. Returning to the familiar tools of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML5 felt great. I took it upon myself to use very few external resources for these projects I had in mind to add to my portfolio just like I had in my youth. I wanted to limit what I could use and see what I could create. The browser games I made were versions I had created growing up...along with some new ones.

* These animations tested the boundaries and limits of what I was using by integrating WebGL, Three.js, and Cannon.js for complex tasks. 98% of these projects were crafted exclusively through code.

* The primary objective of this endeavor was to emphasize that immersive animations and engaging games just like when I was growing up can be brought to life solely through code. Plus I love a good challenge. To further expand my skills, I learned Cannon.js, Three.js, WebGL, and Canvas during this process.
