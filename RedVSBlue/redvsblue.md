- JavaScript: JavaScript is used for game logic, player controls, and interactions with the 3D environment.

- Three.js: A popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics and animations in the web browser.

- OrbitControls: A component from Three.js used for enabling interactive camera controls.

- Local Storage: The browser's local storage is used to store and retrieve the player's high score.

- Added view control of belt, high score, lives, score, restart, added more realistic physics, changed the cube color, and added title/animations, basically took it from being an animation to a fully fledged game in 30 minutes.
- Enjoy playing Red vs. Blue and see if you can achieve the highest score! Good luck!
